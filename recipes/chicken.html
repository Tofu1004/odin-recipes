        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large chicken breasts</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Flour (for dredging)</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Chicken broth</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>Honey</li>
            <li>Heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your chicken (cut it in half lengthwise so you have 4 smaller cutlets). Sprinkle them with the garlic powder and salt & pepper and then coat them in the flour.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil and one tablespoon of the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Once the pan is hot, add the chicken pieces and cook them for 4-5 minutes/side or until they're golden. If the oil starts to splatter a lot, reduce the heat. Once the chicken is browned, take it out of the pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Take the pan off the heat and add the rest of the butter, the chicken broth, Dijon mustard, and the honey.</li>
        <li>Return the pan to the stove and adjust the heat to medium. Stir the sauce until the mustard has dissolved (make sure the liquid doesn't reduce completely).</li>
        <li>Add the cream. Once the sauce is bubbling again, add the chicken back in. Let it cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is reduced to your liking.</li>
    </ol>
