    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A yummy, spicy, and savory grilled cheese recipe.</p>

        <p>Use a homemade chili oil recipe or buy one in the store!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Bread (sliced)</li>
            <li>Shredded cheddar (or any kind of cheese)</li>
            <li>Chili crisp</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Directions</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Place the two slices of bread (open faced) on a cutting board. Top the bottom slice of bread with shredded cheddar and dot generously with chili crisp, or to taste.</li>
            <li>Melt half a tablespoon of butter in a non-stick pan on medium low heat. Carefully add the cheese topped bread and top with the other slice of bread.</li>
            <li>Cook slowly on medium-low heat until golden brown and toasty. If your cheese isn’t melting as fast as you like, use a lid to cover your sandwich but keep an eye on the bottom, checking every so often so that the bottom doesn't burn.</li>
            <li>When it’s golden and toasty, carefully flip your sandwich and continue grilling. The second-side grills a bit faster, so turn the heat down to low and keep a close eye on it. When perfect, remove from the pan, slice (or not) and enjoy hot!</li>
        </ol>
